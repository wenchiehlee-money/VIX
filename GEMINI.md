# Project Context: VIX

## Project Overview
This directory is a workspace dedicated to the **VIX (CBOE Volatility Index)**.
Based on the repository name and initial contents, the goal is likely related to financial analysis, data collection, or modeling of the VIX.

**Current Status:** Initialization / Early Stage. The repository currently contains only basic metadata files.

## Directory Overview
The current directory structure is minimal:

*   **`README.md`**: Contains the project title and a brief description ("Working space for VIX").
*   **`LICENSE`**: MIT License (Copyright 2025 wenchiehlee-money).
*   **`GEMINI.md`**: This context file.

## Usage & Conventions
As no code or specific configuration files (like `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, etc.) exist yet, there are no established build or run commands.

**Future Considerations:**
*   If this becomes a **Python** project (common for finance), look for `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `.ipynb` notebooks.
*   If this becomes a **Node.js** project, look for `package.json`.

## Task History
*   **2025-12-10**: Context file `GEMINI.md` generated for the first time.
